#Ocean Depletion Factors Analysis

This dashboard provides an interactive and visual representation of the factors affecting ocean depletion, such as:

CO2 Levels
Water Temperature
Chemical Contamination
Features:
Interactive Visualization:

Users can explore how different environmental factors contribute to ocean depletion.
Plots include line charts, scatter plots, and bar charts, which dynamically change based on user input.
Geographical Insights:

The dashboard allows users to filter data by geographic regions (latitude and longitude) to observe depletion trends in specific areas.
Real-time Data Interaction:

Users can select different parameters (e.g., CO2 levels, water temperature) to see the corresponding changes in the ocean depletion rate.
3D Visualization:

The dashboard supports 3D graphs for a more detailed understanding of how various factors correlate with each other spatially and temporally.
Data Source:

The data used in this dashboard is derived from the CSV file large_ocean_depletion_factors.csv, containing real-world environmental data related to ocean health.
Tools and Libraries:
Streamlit: The main framework for deploying the dashboard, providing seamless web-based interaction.
Plotly: For creating rich and interactive visualizations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For static visualizations when required.
This dashboard serves as a tool for researchers, environmentalists, and policy-makers to understand and visualize the critical factors affecting the health of our oceans.
